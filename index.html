        <h2>How to Use:</h2>
        <p>This app is designed for mason brick layers to calculate brick spacings quickly and accurately in conjunction with either a standardized or over size brick spacing ruler. Follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the desired height you want to lay to in inches or feet and inches.</li>
            <li>Select the spacing size you want to use from the options available.</li>
            <li>Click the "Calculate" button to check how well the selected spacing size hits the desired height.</li>
            <li>If needed, the app may adjust the spacing size or calculate a remainder for a rip to achieve the desired height.</li>
            <li>Lastly, mark out the calculated coursing with your spacing ruler.</li>
        </ol>
